# 🏥 AI-Powered Digital Healthcare & Wellbeing Platform

A unified *Web + Mobile + AI/ML* based healthcare ecosystem designed to improve *preventive care, telemedicine, health monitoring, maternal support, mental health services, and portable diagnostics, with a strong focus on **rural and underserved communities*.

---

## 🚀 *Project Overview*

This project integrates *machine learning, telemedicine, wearable health monitoring, cloud infrastructure, and portable diagnostic systems* into a single digital health platform.
It enables early disease prediction, remote consultations, real-time vitals tracking, mental health support, maternal care automation, and district-level public health analytics.

The system is built to reduce hospital overload, improve accessibility, and support government health planning.
